# Las Vegas Tourist Classification Project
I attempt to classify Las Vegas Strip tourists into various categories based on information about the ammenities of a las vegas strip hotel they stayed at and
 meta data from their trip advisor review.

The data can be found online at UC Irvine's machine learning repository site: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Las+Vegas+Strip 

There are three items contained within this folder:

1. LasVegasTripAdvisorReviews-Data.csv: The raw data downloaded from the URL above

2. Tourist_Classification_TripAdvisor.Rmd: An R-markdown report and analysis of the las Vegas TripAdvisor Data.

3. Tourist_Classification_TripAdvisor.Rproj: The R project file. Please open this project file first before opening the markdown file.
